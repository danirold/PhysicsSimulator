# PhysicsSimulator

Gravitational physics simulator developed as part of the Tecnología de la Programación II course, belonging to the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The project implements a physics engine using Java to simulate the interaction and movement of spherical bodies under gravitational forces. It features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that visualizes real-time trajectories and dynamics based on defined physical rules. The development focuses on software architecture and the implementation of graphical interfaces to represent complex physical systems.

This project was developed in collaboration with Sergio Martínez Olivera (https://github.com/sergiio8).
